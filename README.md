# Dynamic Formula Execution API

## Overview

The **Dynamic Formula Execution API** is a Python-based API that interprets and executes complex mathematical formulas on structured datasets. It supports formula chaining, validation, and real-time calculation of values across various data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, dates, and currencies. The solution ensures efficient performance with sub-second response times, making it suitable for large datasets and complex workflows.

This API was developed as part of a coding challenge to demonstrate key skills in Python, FastAPI, and mathematical expression evaluation.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI was selected for the following reasons:
- **Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks, built on top of ASGI and supports async programming, which helps to efficiently handle I/O-bound operations.
- **Ease of Use**: FastAPI has automatic request validation, serialization, and generation of OpenAPI documentation, which helps to reduce boilerplate code and improve development speed.

## Features

- **Dynamic Expression Evaluation**: Supports dynamic evaluation of mathematical expressions based on input variables.
- **Formula Chaining**: Formulas can depend on the output of other formulas, allowing for complex workflows.
- **Topological Sorting**: Ensures that formulas are executed in the correct order based on their dependencies.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling for invalid expressions and missing input variables.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily extendable to support additional data types or more complex formula logic.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pydantic**: For data validation.
- **FastAPI**: For building the API.
- **Uvicorn**: For serving the application.
- **re**: For regex operations in currency/percentage parsing.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- pytest (for running tests)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NishanthMuruganantham/dynamic-formula-execution-api.git
    cd dynamic-formula-execution-api
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    Use `pip` to install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Tests**:

    Execute the unit tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

### API Endpoints

The API exposes endpoints to execute formulas dynamically using FastAPI. The main endpoint accepts the dataset and the list of formulas to be executed.

#### Endpoint: `/api/execute-formula`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Executes the provided formulas on the given data and returns the results.

## Usage

To use the API, you can run the FastAPI server locally:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the API, and you can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to send requests to the `/execute-formulas` endpoint.

## Key Components

### FormulaExecutor Class

The `FormulaExecutor` class is responsible for processing a list of formulas on the dataset. It first sorts the formulas based on their dependencies using topological sorting and then evaluates each formula dynamically.

#### Key Methods:
- **`perform_formula_execution`**: Executes all formulas in the correct order and returns the results.
- **`_topologically_sort_formulas`**: Sorts formulas based on dependencies.
- **`_execute_formula`**: Safely evaluates a single formula on a given dataset.

### Models

- **Data**: Represents the dataset structure.
- **Formula**: Defines each formula's expression and input-output variables.
- **Inputs**: Represents input variables for formulas.
- **ResultBody**: Holds the results of formula executions.
